# Everyst - Server Management Dashboard

![Everyst Logo](./public/images/everyst-logo.svg)

## Hey there, welcome to Everyst

Everyst is a server monitoring and security management platform built with React, TypeScript, and Django. It aims to provide a modern, responsive interface for monitoring system metrics and security.

**Important note:** This project is currently in **Alpha 1** stage. It's very much a work in progress, and I'm sharing it early to gather feedback and collaborate with others interested in this space.

## Why Everyst Exists

I’m building Everyst a server management dashboard that’s simple, fast, and secure. I wasn’t happy with existing options like Webmin or Cockpit (they felt slow or outdated) so I decided to make something better.

Everyst uses React, TypeScript, and Django to give a clean and responsive interface for monitoring system metrics and managing security. It’s still early days (Alpha stage), but the goal is to have a reliable tool that works well for my homelab and anyone else who wants something lightweight and modern.

## Technical Foundation

Everyst is built on:

### Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite with Tailwind CSS for responsive design

### Backend

Django + Socket.IO for API endpoints and real-time updates

## Getting Started

Want to play around with the project? Here's how:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment tool (venv recommended)
- curl

### Installation

We provide two scripts to help you get Everyst up and running: one for a production-like server setup and one for local development if you wish to contribute or modify the code.

#### Production Installation (Not Recommended)

WARNING: This isn't really ready, I wouldn't recommend installing yet. NOT stable. Please use the development setup instructions below instead.

This script prepares Everyst for a production-like environment. It creates a dedicated system user (`Everyst`), builds the frontend for production, and sets stricter file permissions.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jordonh18/Everyst.git
   cd Everyst
   ```

2. Run the production installation script with sudo privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

   The script will:
   - Perform prerequisite checks.
   - Create a system user named `Everyst`.
   - Set up the Python virtual environment.
   - Install backend and frontend dependencies.
   - Run database migrations.
   - **Build the frontend for production (`npm run build`)**.
   - Set file ownership and permissions for the `Everyst` user (this user will own the application files, database, etc.).
   - Optionally, create a systemd service file to manage the Everyst application.

   Follow the on-screen prompts and messages for further instructions, especially regarding the systemd service and production Django settings.

#### Development Setup (For contributing or local modification)

If you'd like to contribute to Everyst or set up a local development environment to modify the code, this script will help you get started. It installs necessary dependencies and configures file permissions for your user.

**Note:** For deploying on a server, please use the Production Installation script above.

1. Clone the repository (if not already done):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jordonh18/Everyst.git
   cd Everyst

2. Set up your environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file to customize your settings. See [Environment Variables Guide](docs/getting-started/environment-variables.md) for details.
   ```

3. Run the development setup script with sudo privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup-dev.sh
   ```

   The script will:
   - Check for and optionally install prerequisites (Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, npm, curl).
   - Create a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
   - Install backend dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
   - Run database migrations.
   - Install frontend dependencies (`package.json`).
   - Set appropriate file ownership and permissions for development (e.g., your user will own the database file).

4. After the script completes, activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   sudo npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application at `https://localhost:5173`

   Both the frontend and backend are configured to use HTTPS with the certificates in the `certs` folder. Since we're using self-signed certificates for development, you may need to accept the security warnings in your browser.

## Contributions Welcome

I'd love your help with this project! It's in its early days, and contributions of all kinds are welcome.

Feel free to:

- Submit issues for bugs you find
- Suggest features you'd like to see
- Fork the repo and submit pull requests
- Share feedback on the current implementation

No contribution is too small, and all are appreciated.

Commenting your code clearly is essential — it saves time and ensures everyone (including me!) can understand the purpose and logic quickly.
